            <li>Phil I hope this is what you were looking for. I spent about 4 or 5 hours on it Sunday afternoon and then night. It was a little more simple than I was expecting so I wasn't 100% sure this is what you wanted.</li>
            <li>I created a "Customer", "Product", "Favorite" tables and populated them with data via my models and DbInitializer class.</li>
            <li>Both product and customer pages have search fields on them.</li>
            <li>Both product and customer pages display data within a grid with CRUD.</li>
            <li>The customer page using a model for a partial view.</li>
            <li>The product page has a nested table to view customers who have favorite a product.</li>
            <li>For the DbInitializer I used both a collection and list just to display how both function.</li>
            <li>I created relational data between the product and customer via a favorites table. In the details of each product and customer you can see them listed. Also in the index of customer is a link to a favorites page with the ablity to delete and create favorites for each customer.</li>
            <li>If there is anything you would like me to add to this please let me know.</li>
        </ul>
